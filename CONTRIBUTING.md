# How to help Tax
I don't actually want your help, but if you must:
1. Check if the bug is actually Syn's fault (It usually is).
2. Submit a Pull Request.
3. If I like it, I will merge it and tell everyone I thought of it first.
4. Don't ask for a 'Contributor' badge. The only badge you get is the satisfaction of serving the Vibe.
