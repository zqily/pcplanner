## About The Project

I was planning a new PC build and grew tired of the tedious, repetitive chore of checking component prices every few days. Manually visiting half a dozen product pages, copying the new prices into a spreadsheet, and recalculating the total cost was a massive headache.

This project was built to solve that exact problem.

The PC Planner is a simple but effective Python application with a clean GUI. You input the Tokopedia links for your desired components, and with a single click, it scrapes the live name and price for every item, instantly updating your total build cost. What used to be a 15-minute chore is now a 5-second task.

### Key Features

-   **ðŸ’° Live Price Scraping:** Automatically fetches the latest item names and prices from any valid Tokopedia URL.
-   **âš¡ Multi-threaded Performance:** Scrapes all component pages concurrently, making the update process fast and efficient.
-   **ðŸ“‹ Organized Layout:** A clean UI with separate tabs for core PC components and peripherals.
-   **ðŸ“Š Automatic Totals:** The total cost of the build is calculated and displayed in real-time.
-   **ðŸ’¾ Persistent Data:** Your list of links is automatically saved and loaded between sessions.

### Built With

-   [Python](https://www.python.org/)
-   [PyQt6](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/) for the GUI
-   [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) for web scraping

## Limitations & Technical Notes

-   **Tokopedia Only:** This scraper is specifically designed for **Tokopedia** product pages and will not work with other e-commerce sites like Amazon or Shopee.
-   **Scraping Approach:** I initially attempted to add Shopee support, but their anti-bot measures proved too robust for a simple implementation. I also experimented with more advanced libraries like Playwright, but found they were surprisingly detected and blocked by Tokopedia. The simpler, classic combination of `requests` and `BeautifulSoup4` worked flawlessly and was more than fast enough for this use case.
