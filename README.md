  <b>PC Planner</b> is the "Surveillance Arm" of the build process. 
  <br />
  It monitors the market so you don't have to experience the manual labor of "updating a spreadsheet."

## ⚡ The Vision

### 🕵️‍♂️ Financial Surveillance (Scraping)
*   **Targeted Acquisition:** Specifically tuned for Tokopedia. Why? Because Shopee’s anti-bot measures require "effort," and effort is against the Syntax Free Manifesto.
*   **Multi-threaded Greed:** Scrapes every component simultaneously. If Tokopedia thinks it's a DDoS attack, that's just a compliment to my efficiency.
*   **Automatic Image Extraction:** It grabs the pixels so you can stare at the GPU you can't afford in 4K.
> **Syn:** `he's been planning the pc for 2 years, but don't have the money for it yet. likely ever.`

### 🏛️ The "Robust" Backend (SQL Migration)
*   **Legacy is Dead:** We moved from `data.json` to **SQLite**. Why? because it's robust as hell and AI can code it.
*   **Atomic Persistence:** Your builds are stored with transactional integrity. If the app crashes (it won't), your data survives the wreckage.
*   **Migrator Engine:** Built a custom bridge to move your old "peasant" JSON data into the SQL empire.

### 📈 The Depression Curve (Analytics)
*   **Price History:** Tracks every fluctuation. Watch your dream build get more expensive in real-time.
> **Syn:** `went up from 30m to 37m in 2 years.`
*   **Matplotlib Integration:** Visualizing my financial ruin with high-fidelity graphs.
*   **Delta Tracking:** Green arrows for hope, Red arrows for reality.
